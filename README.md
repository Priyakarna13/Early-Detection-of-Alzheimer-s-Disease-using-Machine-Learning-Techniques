# Early-Detection-of-Alzheimer-s-Disease-using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
Aimed at assisting Medical professionals in early AD detection.Model built and trained over Random Forest algorithm after being tested over various ML algorithms.
Models trained are:
-Logistic Regression(with Imputation)
-Logistic Regression(with dropna)
-Support Vector Machine
-Decision Tree
-Random Forest
-AdaBoost
-Max Voting(using new untrained models)
-Bagging
-Averaging(using new untrained models)
-Max voting(using previously trained models)
-Gradient Boosting
-Averaging(using previously trained models)
