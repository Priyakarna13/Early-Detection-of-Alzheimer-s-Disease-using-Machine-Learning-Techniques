# Early-Detection-of-Alzheimer-s-Disease-using-Machine-Learning-Techniques

## Abstract

Alzheimer’s Disease is a severe neurological brain disorder. It destroys brain cells causing people to lose their memory, mental functions and ability to continue daily activities. Alzheimer’s Disease is not curable, but earlier detection can help improve symptoms in a great deal. Recognizing symptoms as early as possible (Pre-detection) is crucial as disease modifying drugs will be most effective if administered early in the course of disease, before the occurrence of irreversible brain damage. Therefore, there is a high importance of utilizing automated techniques for the purpose of pre-detection of AD symptoms from data available.

## Proposed System

This project is aimed at Medical professionals in early AD detection using numeric fMRI data with demographic and clinical predictors. 
We developed and Evaluated multiple Machine Learning algorithms including 
+ Logistic Regression with Imputation and with DropNA
+ SVM
+ Decision Tree
+ Random Forests
+ Adaboost
+ Max Voting
+ Bagging
+ Averaging
+ Gradient Boosting

## Results

Based on this analysis, we present to you, a Random forest classifier, as the best algorithm to predict the probable presence of AD in the early stages with the accuracy of 86.6%.
